# Book-Classification-Tutorial
This repository is your opportunity to practice using Git to clone a software repository, make and track changes to your own copy, and integrate those changes back into the original.

I suggest that you:

1. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [clone your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
2. Open the Tut8.R file and add your favorite public domain novel to the list of titles.
3. Modify the topic model and classifier to best adapt to the new corpus.
4. [Commit your changes](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project) to your local repository.
5. [Push your changes](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github) to your remote repository.
6. (Optional) [Submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to the original repository to have yourchanges merged with the original.

Feel free to try whatever other changes you want to make - your fork, your rules!
